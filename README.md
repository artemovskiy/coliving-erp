# This is a (very) simple ERP for coliving projects

### What is coliving
Coliving is an organisation of sharing an estate(flat or house) among several people, who are comfortable to live togetther. Together we can get a better house and lower pri—Åe per person.
It is almost same with getting an rent appartment with friednds, but assumes inviting new people.

### Why do we need this software?
Although a coliving has several common features with a dormitory or a hotel, but some features are drastically different. Firstly we started with an Excel spreadsheet, but it became too complicated later.
Then we have tried to adapt a hotel ERP solution for our project, but it was not very suitable.

### What features does the software has?
Not to much right now. It allow to register residents, plan accommodations, analyze facilities utilization and predict budget incomes.
